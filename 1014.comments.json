[{"body":"\u003e this has to stop the starting up process\r\n\r\nWell, not necessarily. With every user setting you can either fail on problems or use a plausible/useful default instead. In this case I agree though. If the specified cert can not be loaded the startup should probably fail.\r\n\r\n\u003e The self signed cert that is generate by murmurd has to be delete out of the database by calling murmurd with -wipessl\r\n\r\nIt seems you are not familiar with Murmurs ini configuration and vserver concept.\r\nThe ini file provides default values for the potentially multiple vservers (servers you can connect to) that the process runs.\r\n(This way you can for example provide a default welcome text for all vservers, but still specify specific ones for the individual vservers overriding the default.)\r\nSo I guess you set your certificate only via the murmur.ini. Thus, only the default is set while the vserver already has a specific self-generated certificate, thus not using the default any more. Wiping this certificate will make murmur use the default again.\r\n\r\nI guess the wiki could really use a how to own-cert, if it does not provide one yet.","user":{"login":"Kissaki"},"created_at":"2013-08-16T14:03:42.259Z"}]
