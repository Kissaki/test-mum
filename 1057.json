(Tried locate32 and found nothing)\r\n\r\nSo i took to \"drastical\" measures and removed all registry keys marked murmur/mumble, i removed all files on the drive that Mumble tries to start (iosnoop) and still i can't install Mumble 1.2.5 because of this bloody MSI file.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1057/ .*","user":{"email":"torxed@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-11-03T09:38:55.259Z","updated_at":"2013-11-03T09:38:55.521Z"}
