What Koby said is most likely true. Make sure your filename and target directory template strings are ok (e.g. there's a %user in there when recording multichannel).

It doesn't affect functionality though.\r\n\r\nIf the issues persist please post your target directory and filename string.\r\n","user":{"login":"dD0T"},"created_at":"2013-10-22T21:37:57.409Z"}]
