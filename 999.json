Mumble 1.2.4 (but this happened once with 1.2.3a, described in the verbose section below). On-board sound card, RealTek something-or-other.\r\n\r\nShort version:\r\nThis series of steps always has the same result: \r\n-- Re/Start computer, start Mumble.\r\n-- I can talk in Mumble.\r\n-- Close Mumble, sleep computer\r\n-- Wake computer, start Mumble, \r\n-- I cannot talk in Mumble.\r\n\r\nThings that don't let me talk: \r\n-- closing and restarting Mumble after the sleep. \r\n-- rebinding/reassigning the PTT key. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I've found that lets me talk in Mumble after this happens: \r\n-- restarting my computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuper-verbose wall-of-text version:\r\nOn Sunday June 2 2013, I brought my computer out of sleep mode and started up my Mumble client. My Mumble 1.2.3a client advised me to upgrade to 1.2.4. At this time, for the first time, I was unable to talk in Mumble after the computer had been asleep (I would push the key -- it's bound to the ~ key -- and my my mouth-icon on Mumble didn't light up on my screen and nobody could hear anything I said). I assumed it was related to needing to update, so I installed 1.2.4. \r\nThe problem has persisted. I've googled and found some threads that sound similar to this problem, but my problem differs; in some of the other threads, the posters say that if they go into the options and re-set their PTT binding, the problem is fixed, but when I attempt to reset my binding, my problem is not fixed. The only thing that allows me to talk in Mumble again is a full shut down and restart of my computer. \r\n\r\nOn June 18th, I created a registry key as outlined in \r\nhttp://mumble.sourceforge.net/1.2.4_Known_Issues\r\n\"Global Shortcuts stop working randomly on Windows\"\r\n\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\LowLevelHooksTimeout (it does not exist by default)\r\nThis key should be of type DWORD, and its value is specified in milliseconds.\"\r\nI set the value to \"3e8\" hexidecimal, as stated. I restarted my computer, Mumble worked fine. I exited Mumble, slept the computer, woke the computer, started Mumble, and I cannot talk.\r\n\r\nNone of the ~50+ other people that I know that use Mumble have said they have this problem. When I was notified to upgrade to 1.2.4, I made a post that they should also upgrade, so I assume at least 15-30% of them have done so already, but I have not seen anyone mention anything about having a similar issue.\r\n\r\nBug reports of some similarity, yet my problem is distinct from these for various reasons:\r\n\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/879/\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/636/ - this person says their problem arises when they sleep the computer with Mumble open. I have always disconnected and closed Mumble before sleeping the computer, as I seem to find that Mumble-open-while-sleeping results in robot-voice after un-sleeping. \r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/298/ - the original post is from 2009, so I don't know if it still counts. Both the original poster and the additional commenter on page 2 describe almost exactly the same problem that I have, except they both state that they leave Mumble open and connected while they put their computer to Sleep-mode, and that quitting Mumble and reconnecting or attempting to rebind the PTT key will fix their problem.\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/997/ - unlike this poster, my Mumble works perfectly fine for the entire time I want to use it, but only after a re/start of my computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can do anything to fix the problem.
