{"number":1128,"state":"open","title":"enhance logging features of murmur","body":"logging in murmur is currently controlled via murmur.ini\r\nat the moment there is only one key to set the logfile.\r\nplease consider adding a loglevel, so one does not  have to decide wether to throw away warnings or to keep private user data.\r\nalso, a switch to control which logging feature is used would be very useful. decision between syslog, logfile and other logging methods should be made by the user.\r\nan implementation of these features would significantly lower work for hosting murmur on a unix system.\r\nthanks for considering\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
