{"number":964,"state":"open","title":"Multichannel-Recording gets out-of-sync when UDP packets lost","body":"I have a 2h multichannel-recording with two people in Mumble, where one resulting file is 3 seconds shorter than the other. In the beginning everything is ok, but after 30 minutes there were some UDP transmission problems caused by one user doing heavy uploads on his side. Right after the transmission error, the channels were heavily out-of-sync.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the source, I found some code generating silent samples when there are missing samples - but only when the silence period is larger than 100ms. Do you think that our silence period was shorter? BTW, I used WAV for recording.\r\n\r\nOur settings are shown on the screenshots found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sowennet.de/mumble\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/964/ .","user":{"email":"msowen@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-02-20T21:44:23.411Z","updated_at":"2013-10-31T03:06:51.464Z"}
