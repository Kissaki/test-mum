Also, forum reports I've seen from customers are not incredibly detailed. I can inquire on the forums about the Mumble versions being used.\n\nI have one crash dump with a mumble_ol.dll (not directly implicated in this particular crash) with a timestamp of \"2-19-2011 2:44 PM\" but I'm not sure if that's just a Windows file modification timestamp. MSVC reports the module info as follows:\n\nmumble_ol.dll   *C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mumble\\mumble_ol.dll    N/A N/A No matching binary found.       63  0.00.0.0    2/19/2011 2:44 PM   6A430000-6A453000   CrashDump.mdmp: Native\n\n________________________________\n\nSent from sourceforge.net because you indicated interest in https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/983/\n\nTo unsubscribe from further messages, please visit https://sourceforge.net/auth/subscriptions/\n","user":{"email":"davejrichardson@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-05-13T22:20:07.104Z"}]
