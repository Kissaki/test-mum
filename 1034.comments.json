Execution aborted.\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nYep, we've already set the ulimit properly. I believe that the issue is that the static version of murmur that is offered on the mumble site is compiled with a max fd limit of 1024.   When we compile murmur from source and run it on the server we don't run into the problem\r\n\r\nThanks,","user":{"email":"abrender@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-09-14T21:49:18.763Z"}]
