{"number":989,"state":"open","title":"setting suggestversion via ICE requires bitmasked version instead of \"1.2.4\"","body":"In order to set a suggestversion using ICE you have to set it to the bitmasked version.\r\n\r\nFor example, to set as 1.2.5 via ICE you need to actually set \"66053\"\r\n\r\n(1 \u003c\u003c 16) + (2 \u003c\u003c 8) + 5\r\n =\u003e 66053\r\n\r\nThe mumble.ini expects \"1.2.5\" which makes it confusing between setting via ICE and setting via the ini.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
