{"number":1017,"state":"open","title":"Manual placement lost link","body":"When trying to use the manual positional audio plugin between two users in the same channel, in the same 'context', on a local lan, both clients repeatedly lose the link to the plugin. This is seen both through the loss of positional audio and error messages in the mumble log window. As can be seen below, the connection typically lasts 5-10 seconds, during which audio is indeed received positionally, however it loses the link shortly afterwards, and returns to 'non-positional' audio. For information, the murmur server is also running on one of the client PCs.\r\n\r\nSample log during testing:\r\n[10:26:41] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:26:59] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:27:33] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:28:10] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:28:26] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:29:59] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:30:04] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:31:00] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:31:12] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:31:30] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:31:40] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:31:59] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:32:21] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:32:58] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:32:59] Manual placement lost link.\r\n[10:33:18] Manual placement linked.\r\n[10:33:22] Manual placement lost link.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
