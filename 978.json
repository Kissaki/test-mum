{"number":978,"state":"open","title":"Sound delay when using Pulseaudio","body":"Distro: Debian Squeeze\r\nKernel version: 3.5.3\r\nSound card: CS5535 Audio\r\n\r\nWhen I launched Mumble for the very first time, \"Audio Tuning Wizard\" opened to allow me to configure audio settings. I selected PulseAudio as the Input and Output device and advanced to the \"Volume Tuning\" screen. When testing the audio in this screen, I either did not hear any output or heard output with significant delay of more than 10 s, often garbled. \r\n\r\nWhen I stopped pulseaudio on the system and chose ALSA in the wizard instead, I did not experience these problems in the wizard and was able to get immediate audio output without any delay. \n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/978/ .","user":{"email":"martasd@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-04-08T20:23:48.44Z","updated_at":"2013-05-21T03:44:02.416Z"}
