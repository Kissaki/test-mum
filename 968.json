With it unset, they can message the current channel as long as any user is selected.\r\n\r\nIf the user has the \"edit ACL\" rights in the channel (specific or inherited), these bugs do not occur.\r\n\r\nRight-clicking on a channel the user should be able to message restores normal behaviour\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
