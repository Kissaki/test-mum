Mumble and Murmur work well (newest releases), but I have an odd issue. I tried using the certificate wizard to import a certificate created by StartCom and Comodo, but upon switching to either of them, my server disconnects and says \" Server connection failed: The remote host closed the connection.\" If Terminal is open, it says:\r\n\u003cW\u003e2013-06-02 14:38:31.296 1 =\u003e \u003c1:(-1)\u003e SSL Error: The root CA certificate is not trusted for this purpose\r\n\u003cW\u003e2013-06-02 14:38:31.297 1 =\u003e \u003c1:(-1)\u003e SSL Error: No certificates could be verified\r\n\u003cW\u003e2013-06-02 14:38:31.298 1 =\u003e \u003c1:(-1)\u003e Connection closed: [-1]\r\n\r\nAs soon as I switch back to the self-made Certificate auto-created by Mumble on first use, the server comes back online. It's not a big glitch as I can still use both services fine, but as it was recommended to create a secure Certificate, I wanted to try one. Both certificates end in .p12 and were exported with Keychain access. Both say they were signed by an unknown authority, but I tried telling the Comodo one to be trusted and it still doesn't work. I have also reinstalled both Mumble and Murmur. \r\n\r\nNo rush to reply! Thank you very much,\r\n-Savvy\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/993/ .*","user":{"login":"mkrautz"},"created_at":"2013-06-02T20:01:49.668Z","updated_at":"2013-06-02T20:01:49.959Z"}
