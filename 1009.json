{"number":1009,"state":"open","title":"Unable to turn Noise Supression Completely","body":"As topic says.\r\n\r\nI noticed that i get less hiss no matter what i do with Mumble.\r\nI thought, that maybe it was the encoding (opus), but that wasn´t the case.\r\nAnd i tried changing Noise Suppression up and down (had it on off), but it didn´t change it.\r\nOr well of course increasing made a change, but turning it On and Off didn´t make any change.\r\n\r\nI also tried recording Mumble and Normal recording of the mic at the same time.\r\nAnd as i thought, the normal recording was cleaner but had a bit more hiss.\r\nBut the mumble sound , not sure how to describe it, but not as clean and sharp.\r\nNoise Suppression always makes sound like that more or less, it´s the drawback.\r\n\r\nCan you please look into it.\r\nI prefer to have it completely turned off, as i don´t have a extremely noisy mic, so Noise Suppression just makes it sound worse.\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
