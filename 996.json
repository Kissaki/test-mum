{"number":996,"state":"open","title":"Mumble doesn't reconnect after sleep mode","body":"So, the title says itself. If you put your OS into a sleep mode and then go back, mumble never reconnects. Of course I have all these \"reconnect automatically\" option enabled. I guess that bug started with 1.2.3 beta, because I remember times when mumble always reconnected after sleep/suspend mode.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
