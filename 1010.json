Here is Blizzard's diagnostic ID: 63A85162-5EDB-43DE-89CE-8D4F67676D18. I can't find any logs to provide details. Blizzard's error reporter only provided that reference number.\r\n\r\nMumble/WoW worked fine before the 7/2 rolling restarts. \r\n\r\nReporting to WoW as well, but wanted to let you know. \r\n\r\nI do not know, yet, if this is a Mountain Lion issue or a Mavericks one.\r\n\r\nInteresting note. If you launch WoW before Mumble, everything works fine. If you launch Mumble before WoW, WoW crashes.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1010/ .","user":{"email":"araquen@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-07-03T12:00:50.205Z","updated_at":"2013-07-03T13:24:56.337Z"}
