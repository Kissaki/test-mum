I was able to drag and drop the Mumble app and it did show up. Vent and Adium seem to have \"auto discovered\" and Steam injected itself. But the drag and drop is just as viable a solution.\r\n\r\nNow, though, for some reason Mavericks thinks my Apple keyboard is Japanese, not US extended... Though I can type fine, Mumble shows the \"`\" key as a Japanese character, and won't recognize the key. But that's not a Mumble issue - unless it would be weird that only alpha keys are recognized as English by Mumble. Numeric and keys like []\\,.-= show up as a Japanese(?) character. Looks like the same character no matter what key is pressed.
