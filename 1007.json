{"number":1007,"state":"open","title":"Python scripts incompatible with ICE 3.5.0","body":"Starting with v3.5, the ICE Python wrappers have changed the API used in the Python scripts shipped with murmur (such as testdynamic.py) as well as the convenience mice.py script. It seems that the IcePy::Operation method now requires a tenth argument, indicating the format (defaulting to Ice::DefaultFormat when None is passed). However, this fix doesn't seem enough, since Python strangely segfaults when passing None as format parameter... Attached is the modified testdynamic script including the formatting parameter.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
