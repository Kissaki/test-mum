{"number":1049,"state":"open","title":"Mumble overlay does not work in several games","body":"The Mumble overlay does not work with Arma III, Civlization V, Takedown: Red Sabre and SWAT 4. Here is what I have already done:\r\n\r\n- Disabled Steam overlay\r\n- Run Mumble as admin\r\n- Removed Steam.exe from exceptions\r\n- Added arma3.exe to the whitelist\r\n- Started Mumble after starting ArmA 3/T: RS/Civ V\r\n- Installed beta v1.2.4-165\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm using the sound card of my Creative Tactica 3D Alpha Headset.\r\n\r\nIn SWAT 4 (non-steam) it is possible to get the overlay running, by letting the game load into the main menu and then start Mumble. DxDiag.txt included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
