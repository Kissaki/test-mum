{"number":1054,"state":"open","title":"Protocol docs: make the use of protobuf more clear.","body":"Imisnew2 on IRC had a problem when trying to implement a Mumble client using the PDF protocol doc in the repo.\r\n\r\nHe receieved a Version message from the server and stared at the protobuf marshalled message's raw bytes trying to make sense of it. (It should be a uint32 signalling 1.2.4, but the protobuf encoding meant that he couldn't map it to anything that made sense.)\r\n\r\nIt seems the current protocol docs aren't clear enough about how protobuf is used in the protocol, and we should improve that:\r\n\r\n17:06 \u003c Imisnew2\u003e mrkrautz: And marshall it as well ;) The documentation is VERY misleading about this, if you could pass it along.  It says it uses protobuf, but it looked like it was saying that the protobuf part was only the header (6bytes).  It even goes as far as how to break down the version portion (2bytes, 1byte, 1byte). I guess it's my fault for not googling protbuf after I saw it, heh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1054/ .","user":{"login":"mkrautz"},"created_at":"2013-10-27T17:17:13.661Z","updated_at":"2013-10-27T17:17:13.958Z"}
