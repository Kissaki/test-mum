{"number":994,"state":"open","title":"Unable to 'Send Message' to Users/Channels","body":"When selecting a user or channel name in the currently active server, you are unable to type a message to any individual or channel using the text input bar. Users still on 1.2.3 connected to the same server do not have the same issue, and are free to text message whomever they wish or whatever channel they wish. \r\n\r\nThe only way to get around this issue is to right-click a user or channel and use the \"Send Message\" function. \n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/994/ .","user":{"email":"velhym@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-06-05T23:52:05.695Z","updated_at":"2013-06-23T05:38:02.962Z"}
