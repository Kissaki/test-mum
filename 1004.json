{"number":1004,"state":"open","title":"Mumble crashing when loading non-included DLLs","body":"Hello, I am working on a plugin, and something strange seems to be happening. It seems that mumble is crashing when it does not recognize the DLL name (ie. if I call my plugin cs.dll, mumble won't crash, but calling it unknown.dll causes mumble to crash). I'm using Windows 8\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n1) Compile positional audio plugin (can post my source code if necessary)\r\n2) Place in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mumble\\plugins named unknown.dll\r\n3) Open Mumble\r\n4) Open Settings, instant crash\r\n5) Go back into plugins folder \r\n6) Rename unknown.dll to cs.dll (A default plugin, which I have moved out of the plugins folder)\r\n7) Open Mumble\r\n8) Open Settings, no crash\r\n\r\nSeems weird to me. Using MumblePAHelper shows that my plugin is reporting the correct values, correct description, etc. even when not using an included plugin name, leading me to believe that this is something wrong with mumble itself. Thanks in advanced for your consideration!\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
