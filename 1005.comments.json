[{"body":"Mine started doing the same thing today. Yesterday it ran fine, I could talk to friends and other co-workers. But today my push to talk wont work. I went though the audio wizard several times, enough to get sick of the 'this is an example of speech' dialog. But nothing I do, even setting to default will fix it. Push to talk wont work, voice activate wont work, etc etc. I can't talk to anyone aside typing. \r\n\r\nThat along with once mumble starts up my system sound starts saying no mic/headset/speakers are plugged in... yet I can hear everything just fine, at max volume.. although some aps lose all sound, but I can hear mumble.
