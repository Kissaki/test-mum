[{"body":"#982 Strong certificate fails if user's stored cert hash is empty\n\nYou mean an association between the email address and the email address from the strong cert?\r\nI donâ€™t think we should blindly trust in even strong certs providing an email address the user owns.\r\n\r\nWhat qualifies as a strong cert? One that is signed by a CA in the used CA list, right?\r\nSo if an attacker can add his cert to the list of CAs he could sign certs to crack accounts by providing the appropriate email address.","user":{"login":"Kissaki"},"created_at":"2013-05-11T15:14:49.901Z"}]
