Otherwise, I can't hear my guild in mumble for raid.\r\n\r\nIf you close all the Razer processes EXCEPT synapse mumble still freezes.

If I unplug my Orbweaver, start Mumble and then plug in the Orbweaver, Sound will continue to be transmitted and received. However; My friends on Mumble tell me the sound becomes completely distorted. Unplug the Orbweaver, everything returns to normal.

Are they using something from the Mumble codebase for their in-game chat system I wonder? \r\n\r\nThis bug is still unassigned, I'm guessing because the devs wouldn't experience it unless they have the self-same setups as us making it very difficult to debug. That being the case, if anyone on the dev team is able to look at this issue I'm willing to do whatever someone needs to help debug this.
