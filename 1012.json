{"number":1012,"state":"open","title":"New BanEditor and UserEditor no longer build on Qt 4.6 (lucid PPA)","body":"Our Ubuntu PPA builds for lucid, which still uses Qt 4.6.\r\n\r\nThe new User Editor and Ban Editor use the placeholderText property of QLineEdit, which wasn't introduced until Qt 4.7.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part is, it's used in .ui files.\r\n\r\nGrep reveals this:\r\n\r\nmumble/ui_BanEditor.h:        qleSearch-\u003esetPlaceholderText(QApplication::translate(\"BanEditor\", \"Who are you looking for?\", 0));\r\nmumble/ui_BanEditor.h:        qleUser-\u003esetPlaceholderText(QApplication::translate(\"BanEditor\", \"No nickname\", 0));\r\nmumble/ui_BanEditor.h:        qleIP-\u003esetPlaceholderText(QApplication::translate(\"BanEditor\", \"No IP address\", 0));\r\nmumble/ui_BanEditor.h:        qleReason-\u003esetPlaceholderText(QApplication::translate(\"BanEditor\", \"No reason\", 0));\r\nmumble/ui_BanEditor.h:        qleHash-\u003esetPlaceholderText(QApplication::translate(\"BanEditor\", \"No certificate hash\", 0));\r\nmumble/ui_UserEdit.h:        qlSearch-\u003esetPlaceholderText(QApplication::translate(\"UserEdit\", \"Who are you looking for?\", 0));\r\n\r\nSince it's from the .ui files, I don't think there's much we can do about it, other than maybe some preprocessor trickery like:\r\n\r\n    #define setPlaceholderText(x) parent()  // turn setPlaceholderText method invocations into no-ops.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1012/ .","user":{"login":"mkrautz"},"created_at":"2013-07-08T00:02:35.109Z","updated_at":"2013-07-08T00:06:13.525Z"}
