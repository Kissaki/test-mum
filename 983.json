Also, forum reports I've seen from customers are not incredibly detailed. I can inquire on the forums about the Mumble versions being used.\r\n\r\nI have one crash dump with a mumble_ol.dll (not directly implicated in this particular crash)  with a timestamp of \"2-19-2011 2:44 PM\" but I'm not sure if that's just a Windows file modification timestamp. MSVC reports the module info as follows:\r\n\r\n\u0009mumble_ol.dll\u0009*C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mumble\\mumble_ol.dll\u0009N/A\u0009N/A\u0009No matching binary found.\u0009\u000963\u00090.00.0.0\u00092/19/2011 2:44 PM\u00096A430000-6A453000\u0009CrashDump.mdmp: Native\u0009\r\n\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
