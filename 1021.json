I'm running mumble in windows 8 (macbook pro with bootcamp), when i try to play something with \r\n              mumble on it makes the game and especially the mouse lag.

Even though DirectSound works fine with \r\n              Teamspeak. Can anyone help me out?\r\n\r\nI suggested to try WinXP compatibility mode to use DirectSound, and that seemed to fix it:\r\n\r\n\r\n22:14 \u003c hte_\u003e mkrautz: Win XP compatibility mode seemed to fix the problem.
