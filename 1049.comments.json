Thanks for that! :D\r\n\r\nSWAT 4 however is a pretty old game. And as already mentioned, the overlay only works, when Mumble is started while being in the main menu of the game.

The issue is basically - the overlay does NOT appear if I start Mumble before starting the game. If I start the game first, and THEN Mumble, it works okay, in the main menu, in a game session, etc. It's a bit annoying not to know why that is the case.\r\n\r\nI've made two log files with debugview (debugoverlay file with no extension is in the main folder as you suggested). The routine was: \r\n1) Starting Mumble, than the game/the game, than Mumble (hence two log files)\r\n2) Checking if the overlay works\r\n3) Closing the game\r\n4) Closing Mumble\r\n\r\nI was trying to make something out of the log files, but I'm not really smarter after comparing them. There is only one line in both logs that is clearly connected to the overlay, but it is exactly the same in both files.\r\n\n\nThe following attachments were added on the original item:\n* https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/_discuss/thread/92e3e73b/5505/62c6/226b/95ae/attachment/mumble%20BEFORE%20swat.LOG\n* https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/_discuss/thread/92e3e73b/5505/62c6/226b/95ae/attachment/Mumble%20AFTER%20swat.LOG","user":{"email":"tpartyka@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-10-20T12:18:50.815Z"},{"body":"#1049 Mumble overlay does not work in several games\n\nIn both we have a `D3D9: CreateWnd` with two following hooks.\r\nSo it is D3D9, and it does seem to hook in.","user":{"login":"Kissaki"},"created_at":"2013-10-20T12:35:06.212Z"},{"body":"#1049 Mumble overlay does not work in several games\n\nWell, if it hooks in in both cases, why can't I see it if Mumble starts first?","user":{"email":"tpartyka@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-10-20T12:39:48.476Z"},{"body":"#1049 Mumble overlay does not work in several games\n\nI do not know. :)\r\nSpecifically, the overlay should show when you start Mumble before the game in more cases than the other way around.","user":{"login":"Kissaki"},"created_at":"2013-10-20T12:45:03.957Z"},{"body":"#1049 Mumble overlay does not work in several games\n\nHmm, that's strange.
