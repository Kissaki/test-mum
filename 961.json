{"number":961,"state":"open","title":"Mumble should not show TTS settings when built with no-speechd.","body":"When built with \"no-speechd\", TTS settings are still shown under Configure-\u003eSettings-\u003eNotifications. This can be *very* confusing when one is trying to get TTS to work by tweaking settings there. (I didn't notice the 'speech' USE flag for a couple days.)\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be to have TTS settings visible, but grayed out. This would indicate that TTS is possible, but disabled or unavailable somehow. That would be far better than tweaking the settings and still hearing absolutely nothing...\r\n\r\nDiscovered on my Gentoo system.
