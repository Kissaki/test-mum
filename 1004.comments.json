[{"body":"Also, it may be worth it to note that the name change/removal of cs.dll doesn't actually seem to remove it, as it is still listed under the plugin list. Nor does changing my plugin name to cs.dll cause it to show up under the plugin list.

I believe that the plug-in is not loading in the reporter's description but rather mumble is re-downloading the original plug-in and overwriting the user's plugin (when the name is set to one of the stock plugin names).\r\n\r\nI am also on Windows 8 running mumble 1.2.4.

To ensure 100% C++ ABI compatibility, you should use the same compiler - otherwise you will most likely get crashes like is described here. :-)\r\n\r\nCan you confirm that using MSVC10 fixes the issue for you? Also, as Micah points out, if you call your plugin 'cs.dll', Mumble is probably using its own 'cs.dll' (either by re-downloading, or by using the one distributed with hte installer) rather than yours.","user":{"login":"mkrautz"},"created_at":"2013-07-01T10:15:11.059Z"},{"body":"- **status**: open --\u003e awaiting-reply\n","user":{"login":"mkrautz"},"created_at":"2013-07-01T10:15:25.248Z"},{"body":"I'm using MSVC10 as my IDE and using the most recent Windows SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh852363.aspx).
