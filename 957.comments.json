I spent forever trying to find if a bug report was opened for this.\r\n\r\nWe recently started using opus on our server and ever since then messages that my friend transmits have a small chance to cause ear shattering pain.  Maybe once every 100 times he talks it does this, but when it happens it's like a bomb went off and my ears ring.  It is seriously THAT LOUD which in my opinion makes this a very serious bug (potential for hearing damage).  It's to the point where I cannot use Mumble with him anymore unless I don't use the headset, because it causes physical pain to my ears.  If there is another user in the channel they hear it too.  You can barely understand what they were trying to say in their transmitted message because it seems like the gain is set to +10000dB.  Then the next thing they say will be at normal, human-safe volume.\r\n\r\nWe are all using the latest snapshot.  He is using windows 8 with his laptop's integrated Conexant audio with the latest drivers available.\r\n\r\nThis never happened when it was using the old celt codec.
