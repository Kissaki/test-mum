It didn't have any issues a couple of days ago and I've completely deinstalled and remove the folder from the roaming area before reinstalling and tried deinstalling the only program that's been installed on my PC since I last used mumble which didn't help.\r\n\r\nI've tried disabling the bonjour service.\r\n\r\nI started on version 1.2.4 and tried updating to the latest snapshot, occurs regardless of version.\r\n\r\nPastebin link of the debug copy-paste; http://pastebin.com/fZZPDk81\r\nI've attached my dxdiag.txt as well, the sound I use for mumble is \"Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)\"\r\n\r\nI'm using Windows 7\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
