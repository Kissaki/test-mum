{"number":1031,"state":"open","title":"Mumble loses sounds after a while","body":"Like the title says my Mumble loses the sounds after a few minutes and it also stops showing that others are speaking but it says and gives alert sound that somebody joined the channel. I have tested in many Mumble servers and every time it stops working properly. I don't know what is causing this problem but it occurs many times in a day. To repair this problem I have to reconnect to server but it won't stay long, after a few minutes I have to reconnect again.\r\n\r\nI really hope that you can help me with this, I really don't know what to do with this. I have tried to run repair and re-installed the mumble but none have worked.\r\nI use Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio) as mumble's output device.\r\n\r\nSincerelly\r\n\r\nKeKsiMonsteri\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
