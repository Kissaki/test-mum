{"number":1044,"state":"open","title":"Mumble freezes when I open the server browser","body":"When I open the server browser, or try to open Mumble without having the 'reconnect to last server on startup' option ticked, the program freezes. I can still talk to people if I'm connected to a server, but the only way I can do anything else is to force the program to close through Task Manager, and re-open it.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
