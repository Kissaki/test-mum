I bound F13, F14, and F15 to PPT and whisper keys several versions ago (back when they still worked). As I updated, I lost the ability to assign any functions to the F13-F24 keys, but I was able to use my old binds.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the binds only triggered when the mumble window didn't have focus. If I had the mumble window selected and tried to transmit, nothing would happen. Also, If I was transmitting and brought the mumble window back into focus, my key would \"stick\" in the transmit position.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my binds were mysteriously wiped recently (perhaps another bug?) and I can't reassign the keys, so I can't do any more testing with F13-F24. I even tried going back to 1.2.4 beta 49 to no avail.","user":{"email":"tcthompson@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-08-06T22:01:35.583Z"}]
