{"number":966,"state":"open","title":"Client (not responding) after a period of time","body":"Normal use, several other programs open. Using Mouse4 as ptt. Within minutes of active use (speaking with others), the client stops responding. The gui freezes (usually it looks like someone's mic is constantly open (lips are always lit up) even though they are not continually talking. I can still hear conversation in the channel like normal, but I cannot talk. My ptt is unresponsive. If I wait it out, after a couple minutes it responds for half a second and instead locks my ptt input and stops responding again. Then my mic is stuck open, until I restart the client. The only way I can close the client when it is like this is to end process through the task manager.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
