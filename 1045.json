{"number":1045,"state":"open","title":"Audio outputs to all Channels of Audio-Device","body":"Mac OS-X 10.7 (or higher)\r\n\r\ni'm using a multi-channel Audio-Device (RME Fireface400 in this case).\r\nMumble (tested with 1.2.3 and 1.2.4) has a bug with such devices as it sends all audio out to ALL(!) Channels.\r\n\r\nThat means: in Case your Device has 10 audio-output channels, Voices are send to all 10 of them. So the sound is a) VERY loud (10 channels sums up) and b) it's impossible to record Microphone, Mumble-Audio and some other Inputs to separate channels with a recording software like reaper, garageband etc. \r\n\r\nMumble should \r\n- either behave like every other software by sending out the output to channel 1 and 2 \r\n- or, better(!), have an option where you could configure to which channels Mumble should output. This way you could let the microphone go out to channel 1 and Mumble to Channel 3 and 4 and maybe other Channels if you have Group-Chats and would like to have each member on a single Channel.\r\n\r\nIn it's current state, Mumble is unusable with Multi-Channel Devices as far as i know. If there are solutions/work-arounds i'm glad to try them\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1045/ .*","user":{"email":"elastico@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-10-06T10:20:34.896Z","updated_at":"2013-10-06T14:57:55.38Z"}
