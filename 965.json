{"number":965,"state":"open","title":"Mumble with very low volume Windows 8","body":"I just bought a new iBUYPOWER computer and installed Mumble, but it doesnâ€™t seem to work.\r\nEverything is fine except the sound. Whenever I try to hear something the volumes are very low.\r\nI tried running the sound wizard a few times with no luck. When it gets to the direction of sound part, I can hear everything perfectly! (When it goes from side to side.) But then it just dies again.\r\nI tried every possible thing without luck.\r\n\r\nVolume and audio work just fine on any other computer aspect. (Ventrilo, YouTube, iTunes etc.)\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
