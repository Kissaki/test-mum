{"number":1015,"state":"open","title":"GUI Unresponsive","body":"I've been periodically having an issue where the entire mumble gui will stop responding and keyboard and mouse input changes aren't registered for about a minute. During this time mumble behaves normally otherwise. It continues to send and receive data and play and record audio. If I was holding my ptt key while it does this the mic is left open until it responds again and conversely if I was not holding my ptt key it will not register until it responds again. Help with this issue would be appreciated. This issue happens about every 10 minutes or so.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1015/ .*","user":{"email":"lasttalon@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-07-16T21:44:24.789Z","updated_at":"2013-08-09T23:34:20.804Z"}
