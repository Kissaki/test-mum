[{"body":"#978 Sound delay when using Pulseaudio\n\nSame issue on Arch (latest version, has been persistent since Mumble 1.2.2 / Arch Iso from June). PA backend lags Mumble and any device on that audio sink, if I use a combined or custom sink for Mumble there is no lag on other output devices on that sink, and using the ALSA backend on top of the PA Alsa compat lib also works.","user":{"email":"korvox@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-05-21T03:44:01.637Z"}]
