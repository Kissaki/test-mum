{"number":990,"state":"open","title":"High TCP ping/ High Latency","body":"Hi everyone,\r\nnow ive been having this issue a while now but as you can see from the link. TCP ping is insanely high. this of course leads to a lot of latency (1-2 minutes!!!) which obviously very impractical when playing games and talking in general.\r\n\r\nI've tried letting through all the ports mumble uses through my firewall but i have no luck at all.\r\n\r\nThis seems to only happen when people start to speak, if i launch mumble muted and deafened then my ping is at a stable 30-50.\r\n\r\nI've quite literally searched every forum post ever to find a solution but have yet to find one, any support will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nlink: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37131449/Extreme%20Ping.png\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
