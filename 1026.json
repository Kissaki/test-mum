{"number":1026,"state":"open","title":"Can't connect to any Server","body":"A while ago Mumble was rejecting me from accessing a Server, and it kept saying that either the password was wrong (it wasn't) or my Username was wrong (it wasn't). \r\n\r\nBut now, even when I select a Mumble Server, it won't even let me connect. The button is greyed out like I can't click it. I'm trying to access the World Nobles Server from a game site, and have been unable to for months.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge.
