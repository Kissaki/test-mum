{"number":1006,"state":"open","title":"Recording is mute after minute 43","body":"I used the Mumble client 1.2.3 on Linux (Opensuse 12.3) to record a three hours long mumble session to a Flac file. All seemed to work well until I hit the \"Stop\" button to stop recording. The client froze, and I had to kill it manually. When I investigated the recorded file, it turned out that it was overly long (hundreds of hours) and only the first 43 minutes contained an actual recording. The rest was mute.\r\n\r\nAnother user in the same session made a similar experience, although I don't know which Mumble version and operating system he used.\n\n\n*This ticket has been migrated from sourceforge. It is thus missing some details like original creator etc.\nThe original is at https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/1006/ .","user":{"email":"klute@users.sourceforge.net"},"labels":[{"name":"recording"}],"created_at":"2013-06-29T09:28:56.095Z","updated_at":"2013-06-29T13:15:07.607Z"}
