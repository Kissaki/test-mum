[{"body":"#1027 poor defaults lead to poor sound and bad initial experience\n\n\u003e The main culprit here is the Amplification setting under Config -\u003e Settings -\u003e Audio Input which bizarrely defaults to 20x amp hence distortion is the default for most new Mumble users. This should be set to 1.0 by default.\r\n\r\nReading the help text for the Max Amplification setting I would expect the desired value to be *highly dependant* on the users microphone (and its quality). I have no idea how the current default came to be, but any other value would be just as random.\r\nWe would need some data basis to work with, to make an educated guess on what a good default level would be.\r\nChecking my input level it seems I donâ€™t get above 25 %, so \u003e= 4 would be a good setting, according to the help text (I actually use 2.5 currently).\r\n\r\nAlso, I guess having too hight of a level is way better than having too low a level.\r\nWhen another person has a value too high you can still hear and communicate with the other person. You may get echo when he is using audio boxes though, or background noises if he has a loud background.\r\nWith too low of a value you can potentially not hear him well or at all, which could make communicating a lot harder.\r\n\r\n\u003e The other poor default leading to unpleasant audio is the audio compression quality, which is too low by default. I keep it at 96K (max) and that brings good results. Maybe it need not be quite that high but it should be higher by default.\r\n\r\nA way lower value should be ok when using Opus.\r\nWere you able to distinguish audio quality between those levels? Which audio codec was in use at these points in time?","user":{"login":"Kissaki"},"created_at":"2013-08-16T13:36:43.155Z"},{"body":"#1027 poor defaults lead to poor sound and bad initial experience\n\nFrom reading reports of peoples experiences with Mumble on various forums etc it seems most get the best sound quality using an amp setting between 1x and 3x. I've not read of anyone having to use 20x. In fact that default only causes probs and makes Mumble look bad.\r\n\r\nI disagree with your stance that higher level is better than a lower one. When a digital audio signal clips ie its too loud it is unlistenable, unintelligible and unusable in recording or broadcasting. Quieter signals may be a bit harder to discern sometimes but at least you have a chance of making it out without damaging your hearing. Lower amp. signals can be rectified whilst overly loud, distorted signals cannot.","user":{"email":"danboid@users.sourceforge.net"},"created_at":"2013-08-17T12:33:36.263Z"},{"body":"#1027 poor defaults lead to poor sound and bad initial experience\n\nMany Mumble servers out there, such as the one we use currently, do not support Opus yet as I understand Opus support only arrived in 1.2.4 so I expect we're using speex?
